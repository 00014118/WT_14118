[{"id":"_5z5vlki","title":"My First Blog","content":"This is a great example of a first blog post. Lauren quickly grabs attention with something cute, shares about her, and includes her husband in the intro. The best part, she adds a story element by telling how she was struggling with POTS, and how just a light bulb inspired her to start her blog."},{"id":"_hhu7u26","title":"Jackie","content":"Jackie shares what the blog is about in simple, creative one line. She uses amusing words, and adds pictures of cute kids playing — that keeps us reading.\r\n\r\nThen, she also interlinks other content on her blog to help visitors find what they might be interested in. Plus, she does a good job using multiple call-to-actions to invite visitors to follow her on social media — a great way to build a community."}]
